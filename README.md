# SwiperMenu for React


https://github.com/AlexMartosP/SwipeMenu/assets/69921633/fc3bded5-5982-4f5d-a0f0-bc1634252ef6


This is a functional SwiperMenu component for React (I don't know if that is the correct name XD). I took inspiration from [Vaul](https://github.com/emilkowalski/vaul) by [Emil Kowalsi](https://github.com/emilkowalski) to create another native like element.

> [!NOTE]
> There is still many features to be added, I just wanted to try and learn how to make it function.

Features:

- Transitions
- If only one option, swipe to activate
- If multiple options, click to activate
